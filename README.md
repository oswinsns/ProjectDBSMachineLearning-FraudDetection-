ðŸŽ“ Coding Camp 2025 â€“ Machine Learning Track
I joined Coding Camp 2025 powered by DBS Foundation, choosing the Machine Learning track to deepen my skills in data science and AI. Throughout the program, I explored how to apply Python libraries like scikit-learn to real-world problems â€” from data cleaning and preprocessing, Visulaiztion, to training classification models (including a fraud detection classifier) and experimenting with clustering techniques.
